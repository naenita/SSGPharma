# Render Deploy Guide

This app can run on Render without changing the database, but because it uses SQLite you must attach a persistent disk.

## What this repo now includes

- `render.yaml` for a Render Blueprint web service
- `scripts/render-start.sh` to:
  - create the SQLite directory if needed
  - run `prisma migrate deploy` at runtime
  - start the standalone Next server

Why runtime migrations matter:

- Render's persistent disk is available only at runtime.
- Build and pre-deploy steps run on separate compute and cannot access that disk.
- If you try to run SQLite migrations during build/predeploy, the real disk-backed database will still be missing at startup.

## Recommended Render setup

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Render, choose **New +** -> **Blueprint**.
3. Select this repo.
4. Render should detect [`render.yaml`](/Users/kanishkadas/Desktop/altamash-paid/medipro/render.yaml).
5. Keep the web service on a paid plan because persistent disks are only available there.
6. Before the first deploy finishes, fill in the missing env values:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com` for production, or your Render URL first
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your-initial-admin-password>`
7. Deploy.

## What the Blueprint config does

- Region: `singapore`
- Build command: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build:standalone`
- Start command: `pnpm start:render`
- Persistent disk mount: `/opt/render/project/src/data`
- SQLite path: `file:/opt/render/project/src/data/prod.db`

## If you prefer manual service creation instead of Blueprint

Create a **Web Service** with these values:

- Runtime: `Node`
- Build command: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build:standalone`
- Start command: `pnpm start:render`
- Health check path: `/`

Attach a persistent disk:

- Mount path: `/opt/render/project/src/data`
- Size: `5 GB`

Set these environment variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=file:/opt/render/project/src/data/prod.db
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET=<random-secret>
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your-initial-admin-password>
```

## Custom domain with GoDaddy

After the app is live on its `onrender.com` URL:

1. In Render, open your service settings and add your domain.
2. In GoDaddy DNS:
   - set `@` to an `A` record pointing to `216.24.57.1`
   - set `www` to a `CNAME` pointing to your Render `onrender.com` hostname
3. Remove any old `AAAA` records for the same hostnames if they exist.
4. Go back to Render and click verify.

## Troubleshooting

### Deploy works but app cannot write database

Check:

- the service has a persistent disk attached
- the disk mount path is exactly `/opt/render/project/src/data`
- `DATABASE_URL=file:/opt/render/project/src/data/prod.db`

### Admin login fails on a fresh deploy

Use the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` value you set in Render.  
On first successful login, the app auto-creates the initial admin row if one does not exist yet.

### You changed env vars but behavior looks stale

Redeploy the service from Render after changing env vars.
